# VTI

ğŸš§This feature is not stable yet.ğŸš§

VTI (Vetur Terminal Interface) is a CLI that exposes some of Vetur's features.

Currently, this is only used for generating interpolation type-checking errors on CLI, which
neither Vue's compiler nor Webpack would catch.

Please send feedback to: https://github.com/vuejs/vetur/issues/1635.
